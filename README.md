This is the supporting material for La Monte Henry Piggy Yarroll's
MS in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, Spring 2026,
advisor John P. Stinnett.

The purpose of the Portfolio class is to summarize the work I've done for
my MS by showing how I've achieved the following learning goals:

* Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable
technologies
* Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal,
business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle
* Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable
insight
* Use programming languages such as Rand Python to support the
generation of actionable insight
* Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a
broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and
technical team leads
* Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and
predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy)
